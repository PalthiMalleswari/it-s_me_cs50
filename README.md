#### Description:

This is my CS50P's final project. **Mail Merging with python**.
By using it i can automate the process of sending multiple mails to everyone at a time with accuracy.

Mail merging is a process of combining a template document with a data source to create personalized copies of a document. The template document contains placeholders that are replaced with the actual data from the data source. This process is typically used to create a large number of documents with similar content but with different personalized information, such as letters, invoices, or labels.

In this Project i've used yagmail library to work with emails.By using Gmail API's i made work easy to send emails without any server connections.and also I've implemented a few functions for validating and sending mails.coming to the testing,i've implemented a few functions to check the working of my project and also i implemented functions to catch any errors regarding Authentication errors and many more.

Actually,I've been working as a Club head of E-Skills in E-Crush Organization.on the occation of Women's Day we have conducted an event called MindFest.For,this we need promotion of event.By using this Mail merging,i'll be able to send emails to all the students of our university IIIT Nuzvid,AP rather than going to each class and do promotions.In this Project i've read the mail Id's of all the students from a csv file and processed it,like validating their mails and filling the placeholders of messages with adequent credentials,sending mails and made it ready for further processing.
